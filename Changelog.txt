- checked out a fresh copy of ScadaBR to document the process of libnodave implementation from the beginning
- no more seroUtils.jar inside the ScadaBR lib folder, so I added one copy here because libnodave4j rely on it

- rxtx Eclipse plugin is required (at time of writing this is around 2.1.4 version)
- lib/RXTXcomm.jar moved here from elsewhere is javax.comm stuff related to compatibility but I think will be 
  unsupported gnu.io version is preferred as stated on RXTX page
- tests which rely on javax.comm have been disabled in the source (org.libnodave.tests)
